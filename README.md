# SimplifyMVP
SimplifyMVP is our effort to create a simple and understandable MVP Library. Idea here is to create a basic code structure 
that can be further extend based on the project needs.

# Why SimplifyMVP?
There are already lots of good article and library available on MVP, then why you need SimplifyMVP?
My simple answer to this question is, thou there are lots of good material available. I personally finds few libraries little complicated 
and there are lots of code which i might not need straightaway.
Therefore, we thought of creating foundation of MVP, that can be further extend.
